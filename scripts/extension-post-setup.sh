# extension-post-setup.sh — Extension-specific setup that runs AFTER Docker Compose
# and AFTER the TEE has been registered on-chain by post-build.sh.
#
# This hook runs once the TEE node is live and registered in TeeMachineRegistry.
# Use it for any setup that needs the TEE's on-chain identity to exist — things
# you couldn't do in extension-setup.sh because the TEE didn't exist yet.
#
# For the orderbook this:
#   1. Looks up the TEE node's signing address from TeeMachineRegistry
#      (getActiveTeeMachines returns the registered TEE IDs for this extension)
#   2. Calls setTeeAddress() on InstructionSender so executeWithdrawal can
#      verify TEE-signed withdrawal authorizations via ecrecover.
#
# Without this, executeWithdrawal reverts with "TEE not configured".
#
# Inputs (env vars, typically sourced from .env + config/extension.env):
#   ADDRESSES_FILE          — path to deployed-addresses.json
#   CHAIN_URL               — chain RPC URL
#   INSTRUCTION_SENDER      — InstructionSender contract address (from pre-build)
#   EXTENSION_ID            — extension id (from pre-build)
#   DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY  — admin key for setTeeAddress call
