# stress-test

Parallel mock traders against a deployed orderbook extension. Stress-tests the
TEE under concurrent deposits, limit/market orders, cancellations, and final
withdrawals.

## Prerequisites

1. Extension deployed and registered (`scripts/full-setup.sh`).
2. Test tokens deployed (`tools/cmd/test-setup`). `config/test-tokens.env` must
   be populated.
3. TEE proxy reachable.
4. `.env` has `DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY` funded with enough native C2FLR to fund
   every trader (default 0.05 FLR each).

## Usage

    go run ./cmd/stress-test \
      -tier=L2 \
      -instructionSender=0x... \
      -duration=5m

### Perpetual mode

    go run ./cmd/stress-test -tier=L2 -instructionSender=0x... -duration=0
    # all traders persistent; runs until Ctrl+C

### Override tier

    go run ./cmd/stress-test \
      -tier=L1 \
      -traders=25 \
      -persona-mix=mm:2,taker:10,walker:10,whale:2,flicker:1 \
      -duration=15m \
      -instructionSender=0x...

## Tiers

| Tier | MM | Taker | Walker | Whale | Flicker | Total | Duration |
|------|----|-------|--------|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| L1   | 1  | 1     | 1      | 0     | 0       | 3     | 60s      |
| L2   | 2  | 3     | 4      | 1     | 0       | 10    | 5m       |
| L3   | 5  | 15    | 25     | 3     | 2       | 50    | 10m      |
| L4   | 10 | 60    | 100    | 20    | 10      | 200   | 15m      |
| L5   | 20 | 150   | 250    | 50    | 30      | 500   | 30s      |

**Persistent trader rule:** every market-maker is Persistent. With
`-duration=0`, every trader is Persistent. Ctrl+C always triggers the sweep.

## Personas

- **mm** — market-maker, posts limit orders around mid on both sides
- **taker** — aggressive market orders crossing the book
- **walker** — random side/type/price within bounds
- **whale** — occasional large market orders (30s between)
- **flicker** — alternates place/cancel rapidly

## What gets exercised

- Deposit flow (on-chain, once per trader at startup)
- PLACE_ORDER direct instruction (limit + market)
- CANCEL_ORDER direct instruction (flicker + sweep)
- Withdraw flow (on-chain, once per trader at sweep)
- Extension mutex, per-pair orderbook mutex, balance-manager mutex

## Known limits

- Traders use their own EOAs, so gas costs scale linearly with N.
- Coston2 public RPCs have rate limits; bootstrap concurrency capped at 8.
- Each order is 1 proxy pending-request slot; total pending capped at 10000
  by the proxy config. L5 (500 traders) can approach this.
